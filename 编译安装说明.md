## 编译说明：
===========

I was able to get this working on Yosemite with the following command:s

```./hm.sh conf -g2 --mac-sdk 10.10 --mac-identity Yosemite --```

Of course, this will only work given you have the dependencies. You can install them with the Homebrew package manager.

```brew install cmake qt```

Additionally, you'll want to build it with:

```./hm.sh build```

And finally, to install it, you'll get the compiled results from the bin folder, i.e. Synergy.app.
