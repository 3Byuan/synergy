Synergy
=======

Share one mouse and keyboard between multiple computers.

Synergy is free and open source (free as in free speech),
meaning you are free to run it and redistribute it with
or without changes.

Just use "hm conf" and "hm build" to compile (./hm.sh on
Linux and Mac).

Happy hacking!


编译指导参考：
===========

I was able to get this working on Yosemite with the following command:

```./hm.sh conf -g2 --mac-sdk 10.10 --mac-identity Yosemite```
Of course, this will only work given you have the dependencies. You can install them with the Homebrew package manager.

brew install cmake qt
Additionally, you'll want to build it with:

./hm.sh build
And finally, to install it, you'll get the compiled results from the bin folder, i.e. Synergy.app.
